Okay, I’ve been posting enough about my day job.

By night I’m a physics graduate student. Well, my work lets me go to
class during the day, but (when I’m productive) night and
weekend minutes are for physics (sounds like a mobile phone commercial).

I’m currently tackling String Theory — we finally have a graduate course
at UCD after my petition to start one last year. Great stuff! The whole
reason I wanted to study physics to begin with. It’s being taught by
Professor John March-Russell, visiting us from Oxford.

Some great material on [Philosophy of Physics by Oliver
Pooley](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0402/teaching/lectures.html): I found
it while reviewing general covariance. Of particular relevance is his
lecture on [General Covariance and gauge
theories](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0402/teaching/handout4.pdf), which
helped to clarify the muddled thoughts I had running in my head.

Paul Ginsparg’s review of [Applied Conformal Field
Theory](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9108/9108028.pdf) posted on
his brain-child, [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/). Necessary material
since I learned the deep-connections between Conformal Field Theory in
2d and string theory are what tell us so much about 2d objects like
strings propagating along a world-sheet.

Belavin, Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov’s classic article
“<!--StartFragment -->INFINITE CONFORMAL SYMMETRY IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL
QUANTUM FIELD THEORY” unfortunately isn’t on arxiv, and right now our
electronic journals aren’t responding, so I may have to track down
Nucl.Phys.B241:333–380,1984 on actual paper.

Well, this was fun but I should go back to reviewing my notes.
