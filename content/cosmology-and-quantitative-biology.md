Went to an interesting seminar today about detecting traces of the
reheat portion of the Hot Big Bang (the part that occurs after
inflation), papers not yet out on arxiv (links posted here when they
come out).  

The interesting bits to relay back here are:  

1. Any symmetry breaking (Higgs, for example) invariably generates
gravity waves. Thus, it's possible for to use gravity waves to probe all
the way back to inflation, 10E-35 seconds.  

2. These gravity waves can be, in principle, detected by tabletop sized
experiments! (There's a group trying to do that now). Unfortunately,
there are issues of sensitivity that will make this rather difficult,
but perhaps by, oh, 2020 we may detect relic gravity waves in the same
way we've already detected the CMB.  

3. Another cosmic relic is leftover magnetic fields, of which theory
predicts their strength and scale should be equivalent to what we're
seeing today as galactic and intragalactic magnetic fields.  

4. Our guest seemed to expect to see copious production of strings and
textures, which should be signified by their gravitational traces and
provides further experimental tests of the
[stringscape](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/30940).  

And in some other news, here's a [really fascinating
article](http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_61/iss_1/42_1.shtml)
on bateriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) with some really nifty
discussion points related to our nanotech thread. I won't spoil the
article, it's well worth the read (it serves as a handy primer for
nanotech issues), but an interesting result is the calculation of
pressure inside the hard shell of a bateriophage, with experimental
support, which shows that:  

1. Bacteriophages have double-helix DNA to serve as a spring to provide
packing energy  

2. Bacteriophages rely upon this pressure to propagate, at least
initially, into bateria.  

3. Viruses are basically mechanical, inanimate objects. They don't do
anything except replicate, and any inanimate matter assembled into the
particular protein configuration of a virus will behave like that virus;
on the flip side, viruses have the exact electrical properties of any
other similar-sized particle in a colloidal suspension.
