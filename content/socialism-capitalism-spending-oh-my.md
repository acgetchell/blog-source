For a change of pace, I'm going to ruminate on the state of affairs as I
see them.

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

(It's my blog, I get to exercise my [First
Amendment](http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am1.html)! ;-)
<div>

  

</div>

<div>

(Yes, I'm procrastinating. The cluster is down for maintenance, and I
need a break from technical reading and writing.)

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

My Pop shared an interesting article during Thanksgiving, which noted
that way back in the beginning of the direct founding of the U.S.A.,
colonists in the 1600's tried a form of socialism wherein the results of
the season's harvest were shared equally amongst the colonists.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

(The account was written by the governor at the time, direct citations
anyone?)

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

The official noted that there were many deaths due to starvation, much
inequity in terms of labor given vs. food received, and so forth. On the
whole, the colony was in danger of perishing as the vicious cycle of
famine made the remaining colonists weaker and less able to work, thus
reducing the harvest, and so forth.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

In these dire straits, the next thing they tried was that they divided
the land up equally amongst the families instead. Each family was free
to keep the results of their work, and if they had excess, sell it for
profit.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

The results were immediate: the next season's harvest was so bountiful
that many families had excess, and those families that did not were able
to buy from those that did. No one starved.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

The official also notes the changes in motivation (paraphrasing): "Women
who claimed infirmity and poor health when compelled to serve the
community went willingly into their own fields with their children. The
high (and unacceptable) costs that might have necessary to compel this
behavior were no longer required ..."

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Score one for capitalism, individual thrift and perseverance, and ....

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

But wait. Where did they get the land?

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Oh, that's right. **They were given it.** Or, from another perspective,
perhaps they stole it. (I don't want to get into those issues since
there's even more controversy about that and it's incidental to my
point.)

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

The point is: the colonists were given the tools to feed themselves, and
they then were allowed to make their own way.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Capitalism is a fine system for efficient distribution of goods,
services, and products. But it was an act of socialism (specifically,
the land grant) that gave those first colonists the means to start on
their new lives. (They had to supply the effort.)

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

We're no longer an agrarian society. We're an [information
one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society).

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

What are the tools needed to make our way today?

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

I'd argue for these, in descending order:

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

1.  Health
2.  Free flow of people, goods, services, and information
3.  Education
4.  Stability

<div>

I'd also argue that lack of any one of these items is problematic.

</div>

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

That last item may be even more difficult to quantify, except that you
know it when you see it: wars, famines, natural disasters, stock market
crashes, etc. Things too big for any individual or family to handle
alone, something that requires a societal solution.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

The world is
[chaotic](http://stason.org/TULARC/science-engineering/nonlinear/index.html).
Trying to impose too much stability results in a dead/fragile/stratified
society (see history for numerous examples). Too little, and [no one can
plan for the future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road).

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

We are a [mixed socialist/capitalist
society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy). Go towards any
extreme for any of the above, and we will suffer.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Define suffering: again, you know it when you see it. Death, disease,
famine, wasted lives, inability to meaningfully affect your own destiny,
loss of freedoms, etc. These are broad brush strokes,
individuals/society will naturally have their own values.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

So how do we provide the above to our citizenry in our society? How do
we give the tools to be successful, without redistributing the results
of that success [unfairly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_division)?

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

(This is not meant as an exhaustive analysis, but a mere framing of the
problem.)

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Government spending:

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Now let me say from the outset, that like general relativity, I prefer
solutions to be as localized as possible. I'd also like to remain as
free as possible from any equations of constraint enforced by some
larger entity. I don't dispute that some are necessary (anarchy is cool
until you live in it), but I wonder if we are half as good at **removing
laws** as we are at [making them](http://law.justia.com/).

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

These entities need money to do their work. Right away that suggests a
neat solution: [don't give them
any](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve). Unfortunately, that
only works if you already have the means to provide the 4 items
mentioned above. Clearly, not all individuals do, so a society based
strictly upon "to each their own" would be [manifestly
unfair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy), and I do retain the
silly idea that [the universe ought to be as fair as
possible](http://www.theonion.com/articles/universe-admits-to-wronging-area-man-his-entire-li,18556/).

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

(Oh wait, we're already a
[plutocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States).)

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Now spending itself is a moderately abstract formulation of reality:
there are only so much goods, services, information, and time available.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Spend less than you make, and you have savings: for a rainy day, or to
help someone else start something they couldn't otherwise do (perhaps
with the hopes that you'll be compensated in the future for lending your
resources today).

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Spend more than you make (if you're allowed to), and you have debt, or
future restrictions on your earning potential.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Pretty straightforward stuff.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

It seems that Americans in general are now used to the consumption
economy fueled by credit and debt, and we've passed that along to our
government. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

That's a fairly common rant, and I'll not repeat it except to say: we've
obviously hit the limit on how much debt (monetary, environmental, etc.)
we've incurred, and we should be looking to pay it off instead of
increase it.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

This seems pretty simple to say and do, but let's watch how events
unfold and see if the [politicians actually
realize](http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1799:dont-raise-the-debt-ceiling&catid=31:texas-straight-talk)
that our government cannot continue to live beyond its means. At least
the [Fiscal Commission](http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/) is a start,
although of course there are economists [who think it's not a problem
after
all](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/1203/Is-deficit-commission-wrong-Critics-say-there-s-no-national-debt-crisis.).

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

I'm not an economist, but there seem to be some pretty [instructive
examples](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2010/1202/After-the-deficit-commission-on-to-Plan-B)
that indicate otherwise.

</div>

<div>

  

</div>

<div>

Okay, back to considering things I have somewhat of a clue about.
