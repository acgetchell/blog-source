Well, the Nobel Prizewinners are to be announced ~~tomorrow~~Tuesday. In
the spirit of fun (and to demonstrate how much science really does
advance), here are some predictions and other fun facts gleaned from
around the 'Net:  

Can you predict the Nobel Prizewinners in Chemistry & Physics by
counting citations? Apparently not:

Since this is an election year, it's interesting to note that 61 Nobel
Laureates (including 22 physicists) -- the highest ever -- support
Barack Obama for President:

Perhaps it's because Obama/Biden actually have a [cogent science
policy](http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/86/i39/8639notw10.html), and happen
to believe scientists when they talk about evolution or global warming.  

Interestingly,
[Reuters](http://uk.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUKTRE49088V20081001)
seems to think citations count for potential Nobel prizewinners:

](http://physics.about.com/b/2008/10/04/2008-nobel-prize-coming-soon.htm)  
They think the contenders are:  

-   **Vera Rubin** at Carnegie Institute in Washington for her [work on
    Dark
    Matter](http://www.amnh.org/education/resources//rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_rubin.html)
-   **Andre Geim** and Kostya Novoslev for
    [Graphene](http://www.sciencewatch.com/inter/aut/2008/08-aug/08augSWGeim/)


[Physics
World](http://physicsworld.com/blog/2008/10/who_will_win_the_2008_nobel_pr.html)
offers the following candidates:  

-   [**Daniel
    Kleppner**](http://www.rle.mit.edu/rleonline/People/DanielKleppner_cv.html)
    at <span class="caps">MIT</span>for inventing the [hydrogen
    maser](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3255423.html)
-   Berkeley’s **Saul Perlmutter** and **Brian Schmidt** at the
    Australian National University for their discovery that the
    [universe’s rate of expansion is
    increasing](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=discovering-a-dark-universe)…leading
    to the concept of dark energy
-   <span class="caps">MIT'</span>s **Alan Guth** and **Andrei Linde**
    at Stanford University for their work on
    [inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation)
-   Chapman University's **Yakir Aharanov** for the <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> [Aharanov-Bohm
    effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharonov-Bohm_effect) and
    **Michael Berry** at the University of Bristol for the [Berry
    phase](http://www.mi.infm.it/manini/berryphase.html) -- the AB
    effect being related to the Berry phase
-   **John Pendry** of Imperial College and Duke University's **David
    Smith** for their prediction and discovery of [negative
    refraction](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/17398)
-   **Roger Penrose** at Oxford University and Cambridge's **Stephen
    Hawking** for their contributions to general relativity theory and
    cosmology
-   **Atsuto Suzuki** from Japan's [SuperKamiokande
    experiment](http://neutrino.kek.jp/) and **Art MacDonald** from
    <span class="caps">SNO</span>in Canada for their work on [neutrino
    oscillations](http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/%7Ejgl/nuosc_story.html)

Who am I going to pick? Well, not because of any insight, but because of
fondness for the topic I'm going with one of the cosmological
predictions, either inflation, dark matter, or dark energy. Maybe
they'll all be grouped together.  

Tune in ~~tomorrow~~Tuesday to see who wins!  

Update: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nambu</span> (of the
[Nambu-Goto action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambu-Goto_action) for
bosonic string theory), <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Kobayashi</span> and <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Masakawa</span> (of the
[Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Masakawa
matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa_matrix)
which describes flavor-changing weak decays) share the [Nobel prize for
Physics in
2008](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/), quite
deservedly, for discovery of [spontaneous symmetry
breaking](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/unify.html).
