Professor Andy Albrecht has kindly pointed me to one of a series of
papers by David Deutsch that begins the proof of Hugh Everett's
[Many-World's
Hypothesis](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/):  

[Quantum Theory of Probability and
Decisions](http://arxiv.org/ftp/quant-ph/papers/9906/9906015.pdf)  

This paper removes the requirement to have a probabilistic  
interpretation of quantum mechanics, instead casting it into a  
non-probabilistic decision theory basis.  

The main result is that the usual probabilistic formulation can be  
replaced by a rational decision maker using classic decision theory.  
Furthermore (and most importantly), quantum processes whose outcomes  
look stochastic can be replaced by deterministic evolution of states.  

Note that this neatly removes the issues around definitions of
probability in the MWI.  

I'm now taking, for fun, an advanced
[Supersymmetry](http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/modernsusy/index.html)
[class](http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/teaching/246B/index.php),
taught by Prof. John Terning, which picks up where my last SUSY class
left off. Wow, I need to
[review](http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/teaching/246/index.php)!
