After a long hiatus, I'm back ...  

Back to what? Well, most of that hiatus was due to work, and I already
keep a (boring) work journal. But the main thing is I'm back to doing
physics ...  

The goal is to start (and finish) a dissertation in Computational
Quantum Gravity. What does that mean, exactly? Well, that's the whole
point of the journey -- and this blog will help me track my progress. It
may not be that interesting to you to read, but it will be useful for me
to write, and keep notes, with. And a goal left unstated is left
undone -- that's why it's all hanging out here.  

So the first order of business is to get really [comfortable with
LaTeX](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf).  

Next, it would be really nice to be able to post equations here. Oh,
looks like someone's already [hacked that
together](http://wolverinex02.googlepages.com/emoticonsforblogger2).  

The Einstein equation:

Here's a really good intro summary on the state of the art on quantum
gravity:

Well, that should be enough to start with this weekend!
