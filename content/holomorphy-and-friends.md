I'm reading Chapter 8 of [Modern
Supersymmetry](http://particle.physics.ucdavis.edu/modernsusy/index.html).  

To understand the first sentence, I had to review Maldacena's
[paper](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9711/9711200v3.pdf), which
(not-so) incidentally proposed the AdS/CFT correspondence (hence its
numerous
[citations](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/topcites/2006/alltime.shtml)).  

Hmmm. I'll have to read it again. ;-) But moving on ...  

Okay, now need to review [non-renormalization
theorems](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9905/9905111v3.pdf) and
[Wilsonian effective
action](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9802/9802109v2.pdf).  

Wow, lots to catchup!
