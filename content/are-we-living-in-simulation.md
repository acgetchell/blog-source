Today I came across one of Dr. Nick Bostrom's [existential philosophy
papers](http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html) regarding
life vs. sim-life (aka are we living in the Matrix?).  

To me, the really interesting question is the assumption of
substrate-independence (because I don't believe we're living in a
simulation, more on that in a bit) -- that
[sentience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience),
[sapience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience), and
[self-awareness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness) can arise
from any appropriately complex material, including computer processors.
Is there some minimal complexity bound for intelligence? (First, tell me
what you mean by
[intelligence](http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/iq.pdf).) On
one hand, we already know that a virus is just a particular aggregation
of molecules, and that any assemblage of those particular atoms will
exhibit the same viral behavior. On the other, does that extend to a
connection between viruses and the rest of the living world, and by
analogy, to bottom-up intelligence?  

Will computers be able to exhibit sentience, sapience, or
self-awareness?  

As an aside, although most people seem to know Seth Lloyd's
[paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908043) on the ultimate limits of
computing, I tend to prefer Warren D. Smith's [Fundamental Physical
Limits on
Computation](http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/fundphys.ps) and
[Fundamental physical limits on information
storage](http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/memorybound.ps) as
being more useful equation-wise (and he has very interesting papers on
[election systems](http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/jcj.pdf)
and [voting](http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/multisurv.pdf),
which doesn't surprise me when it concludes that our current voting
system is nearly the worst mathematically possible, and that[Range
Voting](http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/naturebees.pdf) is a
much better
[algorithm](http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/SSpf.pdf)).  

(Note that some the papers are in PS format, so you will need a
PostScript reader such as
[GSview](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/gsview/get49.htm) along with
[GPL Ghostscript](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/) to read.)  

Before I get too sidetracked, let me outline my reasoning for why I
don't believe we're living in a simulation:  


-   The total entropy/information of our Universe is bounded at [\<
    10E123](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0801/0801.1847v1.pdf)
    (due to the [Holographic
    principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle))

<!-- -->

-   A simple quantum computer with 500 entangled pairs generates more
    information than could be simulated by any non-quantum computer in
    this Universe (2\^500 \>\> 10E123)

<!-- -->

-   If the Universe is not simulated to a quantum degree of accuracy,
    the simulation can be immediately exposed via [Bell's
    inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem)

<!-- -->

-   Thus, in order to create a virtual universe sufficient to withstand
    experimental quantum physics tests, you need 10E123 qubits (e.g.,
    the Universe)


Anyways, this is a very interesting topic, but I should continue my
sidetracking avoidance and get back to my research.
